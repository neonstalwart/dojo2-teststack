# The Dojo Test Stack

The Dojo Test Stack is a collection of JavaScript modules designed to work together to help you write consistent,
high-quality test cases for your JavaScript libraries and applications.


## Does my app need to use Dojo to use Dojo Test Stack?

No! Dojo Test Stack uses Dojo but can be used to test *any* JavaScript code. Its functional testing interface can even
be used to test non-JavaScript Web apps if you really want.


## This repository

This repository is an experimental repository for the next major version of the Dojo Toolkit. Please feel free to start
using it as long as you can put up with some API churn until it reaches alpha.


## Do you hate kittens and love old IE?

If you need to support IE 6–8, there is also a
[version of teststack for legacy browsers](https://github.com/csnover/dojo2-teststack/tree/geezer "geezer branch"), but
please, for the sake of the kittens, stop supporting those browsers already.


## Features

* 100% [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD), 100% Promises/A-based API
* Instant one-off test execution in the browser or Node.js
* Full statement, branch, function, and line code coverage reporting with
  [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul)
* Functional testing using the standard [WebDriver API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) with a fluid, promises-wrapped
  [WD.js](https://github.com/admc/wd)
* Integration with [Sauce Labs](http://saucelabs.com/) for super simple continuous integration
* Tested with [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/)
* Extensible interfaces (comes with TDD, BDD, and objects)
* Extensible reporters (comes with basic console and WebDriver reporters, lcov and tap output planned)
* Extensible assertions using the [Chai Assertion Library](http://chaijs.com)


## How to write tests

dojo2-teststack currently comes with support for 3 different test interface: TDD, BDD, and object-oriented. There will
be more instructions here soon; for now, https://github.com/csnover/dojo2-core/blob/master/test/cookie.js demonstrates
writing both synchronous and asynchronous tests.


## How to run

First:

1. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/csnover/dojo2-teststack.git` as a sibling directory of the package you
   want to test

Then, for a stand-alone browser client:

1. `node dojo2-teststack/runner --config=mid/of/teststack/config --proxyOnly`
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:9000/dojo2-teststack/client.html?config=mid/of/teststack/config&suites=mid/of/suite`
1. View console
1. Fix bugs

Or, for a stand-alone Node.js client:

1. Run `node client.js config=mid/of/teststack/config`
1. View console
1. Fix bugs

For both clients, you can specify a `reporter` and one or more `suites` options to override the options in the
configuration file.

Or, as an amazing fully-featured automated test runner:

1. Create a teststack configuration file describing your desired test environment, like the one at
   https://github.com/csnover/dojo2-core/blob/master/test/teststack.js
1. `cd dojo2-teststack`
1. `node runner.js config=mid/of/teststack/config`
1. View console
1. Fix bugs

…plus CI support:

1. Create a `.travis.yml` like the one at https://github.com/csnover/dojo2-core/blob/master/.travis.yml
2. Enable Travis-CI for your GitHub account
3. That’s it! Easy continuous integration is easy.
